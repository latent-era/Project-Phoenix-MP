# GSD State: Project Phoenix MP

Plan: —
Status: Phase 34 complete — all 3 plans executed successfully

```

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-23)

**Core value:** Users can connect to their Vitruvian trainer and execute workouts with accurate rep counting, weight control, and progress tracking — reliably, on both platforms.
**Last shipped:** v0.7.0 MVP Cloud Sync (2026-03-15)
**Branch:** TBD (from MVP)

## Performance Metrics

| Milestone | Phases | Plans | Velocity |

## Recent Decisions

- Single v0.8.0 milestone for all 29 audit findings (H8 deferred to v0.9.0)
- Phase by subsystem: BLE → Sync → Lifecycle/Security → iOS → Validation
- H6 (sync push transaction) included despite cross-repo scope
- Guided + Deep Analysis workflow (plan approval + thorough analysis for BLE/sync)
- 3 plans per phase: blockers, high severity, medium/cleanup
